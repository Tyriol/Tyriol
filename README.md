## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m embarking on a learning journey through _The School of Code_ to better myself and do something I've always wanted to do.
I'm still figuring out where my passion lies, but I know where it doesn't! So far I've enjoyed the little coding I've done...even the bits where I've been frustrated!
I'll update this as I progress. Wish me luck...
